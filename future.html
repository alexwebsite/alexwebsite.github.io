		<h2>My Future</h2>
			
		<h2>HighSchool</h2>
			<p>I want to go to Millikan becasue I think it is a good school, I like there classes and what they teach, I like there schedule how some times you only get like two classes in one day so you get to get out early and the only thing that I don't like is the way that they have there.</p>
		<h2>College</h2>

		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
			<p>I have a lot of career interest the one that I want to be the most is a firefighter but I heard that you have to go through a lot of hard training and stay fit to be a firefighter. But it would be cool to experence being in fires and saving many peoples lives.</p>

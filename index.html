		<h2>Things I like to do</h2>
		
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>My hobbies are rc cars, gaming, surfing, shooting and camping. I like to drive and work on rc cars because it gives me something to do when I'm bored it is an expensive hobbie but it is worth it. My next one is gaming I don't play that often, I don't have anything expensive and I don't make youtube videos. I don't go surfing that often and I'm not that good at it but I still try I can stand up for a little bit I just can't keep on going. I go shooting every once in a while I can't really hit anything. I like to go camping I go like at least 10 or more times a year. The last time that I ever went was 2 weeks ago over Christmas break.</p>
			
		<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p>I don't have very many interests but the first one that I am going to talk about is shoes. I got interested in shoes in the fifth grade. My first pair of expensive shoes were Kobe 9's. My my expensive shoes that I have to this day are Jordan 11 space jams. My other interest is baseball I played baseball most of my life is play from when I was 5 to 11 years old, the only reason I stopped was becasue I couldn't find time to go to practice because starting in sixth grade they stared to give out alot of homework and I didn't have time to do my homework and do my baseball, but I want to start playing next year in highschool.</p>
			
		<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>I also don't have very many skills my only one is drawing I don't do it very often but when I get bored I start to draw and I'm pretty good at it.</p>
		<h2>Family</h2>
			<p>I have quite a lot of siblings I have a younger sister named Bella, younger brother named Noah and older brother named Anthony and he is 18.</p>
